==================

Topics on this file : **HTTP & HTTPS**

## 1. What Is HTTP?
**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is the foundation of the web — it defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between a **client** (like your browser or app) and a **server** (like a web service).

It's a **stateless, text-based protocol** built on top of **TCP**.\
That means:
- Every request is independent (the server doesn't remember past requests).
- Messages are readable (you can literally open them in plain text).

## 2. HTTP Request & Response Structure
### A. Request
```http
GET /users HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
- **Method**: what action to perform (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) 
- **Path**: what resource (e.g., `/users`)
- **Headers**: metadata (auth, content type, etc.)
- **Body (optional)**: data sent with the request (e.g., JSON for POST)

### B. Response
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"id": 1, "name": "Alice"}
```
- **Status Code**: tells if the request succeeded or failed 
- **Headers**: metadata (e.g., caching, cookies)
- **Body**: actual data from the server

## 3. Limitations of Plain HTTP
Http itself is **not secure** — everything is sent as plain text.\
That means:
- Password, tokens, and cookies can be intercepted.
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are possible.
- Data integrity isn't guaranteed.

## 4. HTTPS (HTTP Secure)
**HTTPS** = **HTTP** + **SSL/TLS encryption** 

It ensures three critical security guarantees:
1. Encryption — Nobody can read your data in transit.
2. Integrity — Data can't be tampered with unnoticed.
3. Authentication — You're talking to the real server, not an imposter

### How it works (simplified):
1. Browser connects to the server.
2. Server sends its **SSL/TLS certificate** (issued by a trusted Certificate Authority).
3. Browser verifies it's valid and from the right domain.
4. They agree on encryption keys.
5. All communication becomes encrypted.

### Key SSL/TLS Concepts
- **TLS handshake**: the initial setup of encryption.
- **Certificate Authority (CA)**: third-party that verifies the server's identity.
- **Public & private keys**: asymmetric cryptography used to encrypt/decrypt data.
- **HSTS**: enforces HTTPS only (prevents downgrade attacks).

## 5. The Big Picture
When you type a URL:
1. Your browser finds the server (DNS + IP).
2. Opens a TCP connection (maybe through a load balancer).
3. Sends an **HTTP/HTTPS request**.
4. The server processes it and replies with an **HTTP response**.
5. Your browser renders it — securely, if using HTTPS.

## 6. HTTP Status Codes
Status codes are **3 digit numbers** that the server sends to the client to indicate "how did your request go?"
- First digit = category (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx)
- Last two digits = specific detail

### 2xx - Success (Request Successful)
#### 200 OK
- Request succeeded, this is the most common response.
- GET successfully retrieved data, POST successfully submitted data.
- *When to use*: Default success response.
#### 201 Created
- New resource was successfully created.
- *When to use*: After POST that creates a new user, article, etc.
- *Best practice*: Include `Location` header with the new resource's URL.
#### 204 No Content
- Request succeeded, but server sends no data back.
- *When to use*: Successful DELETE, or PUT/PATCH that doesn't need to return data.
- *Why*: Saves bandwidth.
---
### 3xx - Redirection (Moved Location)
#### 301 Moved Permanently
- Resource permanently moved to new URL.
- *When to use*: Wesite changed domain, old URL deprecated.
- *impact*: Browser will cache this redirect, future requests go directly to new URL.
#### 302 Found (Temporary Redirect)
- Resource temporarily at different location.
- *When to use*: Maintenance mode, A/B testing.
- *Impact*: Browser doesn't cache, still checks original URL next time.
#### 304 Not Modified
- Resource hasn't changed since client's last request.
- *When to use*: Browser ask "any updates?" with `If-None-Match` or `If-Modified-Since` header.
- *Why*: CACHING - browser can use cached version, no need to download again.
---
### 4xx - Client Error (Your Fault!)
#### 400 Bad Request
- Request has wrong format or missing required field.
- *Example*: Malformed JSON, missing parameter.
- *Best practice*: Provide clear error message.
#### 401 Unauthorized
- Not logged in or token invalid/expired.
- *When to use*: User hasn't authenticated.
- *Response*: Usually frontend redirects to login page.
#### 403 Forbidden
- Logged in, but doesn't have access.
- *Example*: Regular user tries to access admin panel.
- *Difference from 401*: 401 = "who are you?", 403 = "I know who you are, but you can't do this".
#### 404 Not Found
- Resource doesn't exist.
- *Example*: `/users/9999` but that user ID doesn't exists.
- *Engineering note*: Don't expose internal errors in 404 (security).
#### 429 Too Many Requests
- Client sent too many requests (rate limit exceeded).
- *Best practice*: Include `Retry-After` header (in seconds).
- *Use case*: API rate limiting, DDoS protection.
---
### 5xx - Server Error (Our Fault!)
#### 500 Internal Server Error
- Server error, something went wrong in backend.
- *Example*: Uncaught exception, database crash.
- *Best practice*: DON'T expose stack trace to client (security risk).
#### 502 Bad Gateway
- Server acting as gateway/proxy, but got invalid response from upstream server.
- *Example*: Load balancer can't reach backend server.
- *Common scenario*: Deployment error, backend server down.
#### 503 Service Unavailable
- Server temporarily unavailable (maintenance, overload).
- *Best practice*: Include `Retry-After` header.
- *Use case*: Planned maintenance, server overload.
#### 504 Gateway Timeout
- Gateway/proxy timeout waiting for upstream server.
- *Example*: Database query took too long (>30s).
- *Engineering note*: This hints to optimize query or increase timeout.

## Engineering Tips:
1. **Always handle errors properly** - don't jsut assume 200.
2. **Use specific status code** - don't make everything 200 or 500.
3. **Log 5xx errors** - these are bugs that need fixing.
4. **Monitor 4xx rates** - could indicate API design issues if too high.
5. **Use 429 for rate limiting** - better than blocking completely.
